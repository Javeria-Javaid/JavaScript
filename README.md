ðŸš€ JavaScript Learning Journey 
Welcome to my JavaScript learning repository! This documents my progress from fundamental concepts to building real-world projects.
This repo is my coding playground where Iâ€™m figuring out JavaScriptâ€”one bug at a time.
Youâ€™ll find messy experiments, tiny victories, and notes-to-self as I go from "How does this for loop work?!" to building actual things.
ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Inside:
- Fundamentals (Variables, Operators, Loops)
- Functions and Scope
- Arrays and Objects
- DOM Manipulation
- ES6+ Features
- Async JavaScript
- Error Handling
ðŸ›  Projects:
- Calculator
- To-Do List
- Weather App
