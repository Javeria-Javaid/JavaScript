/*
 Day 8: Objects in JavaScript
Objects are collections of key-value pairs and are fundamental to JavaScript. They help you structure and organize data!
 */
//1. Creating Objects
// Object literal syntax (most common)
const person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    isStudent: false,
    hobbies: ["reading", "coding", "gaming"]
};

// Empty object
const emptyObj = {};

// Object with nested objects
const user = {
    name: "Bob",
    address: {
        street: "123 Main St",
        city: "Techville",
        zipCode: "12345"
    }
};
//2. Accessing Properties
